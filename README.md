# Totally-Random-Battle-Simulator
Create a random battle! The limit is the imagination!
This is a battle generator, load your players and start the fight! Help me to create the biggest battle-randomizer of the history!

## How-To

METHOD 1

1. Create a .txt file like that:
```
Name_Of_The_Player_1
Life
attack1_name%&attack2_name%&attack3_name
attack1_value%&attack2_value%&attack3_value
Name_Of_The_Player_2
Life
attack1_name%&attack2_name%&attack3_name
attack1_value%&attack2_value%&attack3_value
...
Name_Of_The_Player_n
Life
attack1_name%&attack2_name%&attack3_name
attack1_value%&attack2_value%&attack3_value
```

```
REMEMBER TO PUT "%&" BETWEEN attack_values and attack_names !
```
2. Once created, save it and import in the browser, and it will do the magic! Easy, isn't it? (OoO)

METHOD 2

1. Click the "SET MANUALLY" button
2. Fill all the necessary fields
3. Click add to add the player
